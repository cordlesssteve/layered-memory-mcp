## Security Overview

The Layered Memory MCP Server implements comprehensive security measures to protect sensitive memory data and ensure secure operation across different deployment environments.

### Security Principles
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for all components
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Privacy by Design**: User privacy considerations built into architecture
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for security monitoring

## Authentication and Authorization

### MCP Client Authentication
- Client certificate-based authentication for MCP connections
- API key management for programmatic access
- Session management with secure token handling
- Multi-factor authentication support for administrative access

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- Project-level isolation and access controls
- Memory layer access restrictions based on user permissions
- Administrative function protection

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- **At Rest**: Database encryption for sensitive memory content
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage and rotation procedures
- **Client Data**: Optional client-side encryption for sensitive memories

### Data Privacy
- User data anonymization capabilities
- Data retention policies and automated cleanup
- Export and deletion procedures for user rights compliance
- Cross-project data isolation

### Sensitive Data Handling
- Detection and special handling of credentials, API keys, and secrets
- Automatic redaction of sensitive patterns
- Secure storage of identified sensitive content
- User controls for sensitive data management

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive audit trail for all memory operations
- Authentication and authorization event logging
- Administrative action tracking
- Security event correlation and analysis

### Threat Detection
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Brute force attack detection and mitigation
- Data exfiltration monitoring
- Malicious query pattern detection

### Incident Response
