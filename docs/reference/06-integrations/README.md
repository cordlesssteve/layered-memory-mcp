### MCP Tool Definitions
The server provides comprehensive MCP tools for memory management:

- `store_memory`: Store new memory items with categorization
- `search_memory`: Semantic and keyword-based memory search
- `retrieve_memory`: Get specific memory items by ID or criteria
- `update_memory`: Modify existing memory items with versioning
- `delete_memory`: Remove memory items with optional soft deletion
- `list_categories`: Browse memory categories and tags
- `memory_stats`: Get memory usage and performance statistics
