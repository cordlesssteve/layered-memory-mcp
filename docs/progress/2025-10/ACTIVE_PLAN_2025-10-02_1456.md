## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Principles

1. **Security First**: All new features must include security considerations
2. **Performance Focused**: Maintain <100ms response times for basic operations
3. **Backward Compatible**: Don't break existing MCP tool interfaces
4. **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality
5. **Documentation Complete**: Full API docs and implementation guides

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript Strict**: Full type safety with strictest compiler settings
- **ESLint Enforced**: Code style and quality standards
- **Jest Testing**: Minimum 80% test coverage on new code
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Validate performance on every major change

## Risk Management

### Current Risks

1. **Security Gap**: Multi-user access without proper isolation
2. **Scale Limitations**: Single-node architecture limits concurrent users
3. **Production Gaps**: Missing monitoring, logging, health checks
4. **Performance Unknown**: Load testing under realistic conditions needed

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Security Priority**: Epic 2.1 addresses authentication and multi-tenancy
   first
2. **Incremental Scaling**: Plan distributed architecture for Epic 4.1
3. **Observability**: Add monitoring and logging in Epic 2.1
4. **Load Testing**: Performance validation before production deployment

## Recommended Next Actions - Truth-First Approach

### Immediate Priorities (Option A: Production Integration)

1. **Verify Current System**: Determine which index.ts is actually running
   (main, secure, or production-ready)
2. **Integrate Security**: Wire security middleware from `src/security/` into
   active server
3. **Integrate Monitoring**: Connect telemetry from `src/monitoring/` to active
   server
4. **Test Production Features**: Write tests for security and monitoring to
   reach 50%+ coverage
5. **Handle Experimental Code**: Document or remove untracked features in
   `src/analysis/`, `src/autonomous/`, etc.

### Alternative Path (Option B: Feature Development)

1. **Optimize Relationship Detection**: Features already enabled; improve
   performance for large datasets
2. **Enhance User Validation**: Refine relationship suggestion approval
   workflows
3. **Expand Decay Modeling**: Enhance predictive capabilities
4. **Benchmark Performance**: Measure and document actual performance metrics
5. **Integration Testing**: Create comprehensive integration test suite

### Stabilization Path (Option C: Quality Focus)

1. **Test Coverage**: Write tests to reach 50% threshold
2. **Code Cleanup**: Remove or document experimental features
3. **Documentation Audit**: Ensure all claims match implementation
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure actual vs claimed performance
5. **Technical Debt**: Address integration uncertainties and gaps

**Project Health - Corrected Assessment**: Solid core memory system with
intelligent relationship detection already operational. Production-ready code
exists but needs integration and testing. Experimental features need evaluation.
Documentation has been updated to reflect actual state vs aspirational claims.
**Next step: Choose integration path (A, B, or C).**
