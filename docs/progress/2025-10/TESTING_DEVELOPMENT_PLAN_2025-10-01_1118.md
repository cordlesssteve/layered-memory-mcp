## Deferred/Out-of-Scope

The following modules will **NOT** be tested in this plan:

### Experimental/Unintegrated Features (0% coverage OK)

- **Embedding Services** (BGE, OpenAI, FAISS, code embeddings)
  - _Reason_: External dependencies, not integrated into main router
  - _Action_: Mark as experimental, document or remove

- **Autonomous Intelligence Service**
  - _Reason_: Not integrated, unclear requirements
  - _Action_: Document as future work or remove

- **Semantic Enrichment Pipeline**
  - _Reason_: Not used by core system
  - _Action_: Move to experimental/ directory or remove

- **Production-Ready System & Secure Routers**
  - _Reason_: Duplicate/alternative implementations not in main flow
  - _Action_: Consolidate or document as examples

### Rationale

Testing these modules would:

- Require external service mocks (embeddings APIs, vector databases)
- Test code paths not used in production
- Dilute focus from core functionality
- Not meaningfully improve system reliability

**Recommendation**: Document these as experimental features or remove if unused.

---

## Testing Standards & Practices

### Test Quality Guidelines

1. **Test Structure**
   - Use descriptive test names: `should [action] when [condition]`
   - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
   - One assertion per test (when possible)
   - Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

2. **Coverage Targets per Module**
   - Critical paths: 80%+ coverage
   - Core features: 60%+ coverage
   - Supporting features: 40%+ coverage
   - Experimental: 0% OK

3. **Test Types**
   - **Unit**: 70% of tests - Fast, isolated, single component
   - **Integration**: 25% of tests - Multiple components working together
   - **E2E**: 5% of tests - Full workflows through the system

4. **Performance Requirements**
   - Individual test: < 100ms
   - Test suite: < 60 seconds total
   - No external network calls (use mocks)
   - Clean up resources (files, timers, connections)

5. **Maintainability**
   - Extract test utilities to `tests/utils/`
   - Use factories for test data
   - Mock external dependencies consistently
   - Document complex test scenarios

### Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing test code:

- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] No console.log or debugging code
- [ ] Test names are descriptive
- [ ] Coverage increased (verify with `npm test`)
- [ ] No new linting errors
- [ ] Used `--forceExit` if async operations present

## Risk Management

### Potential Blockers

1. **Time Constraints**
   - _Mitigation_: Prioritize Phases 1-2, defer Phase 4 if needed
   - _Fallback_: Focus on critical paths only

2. **Test Complexity**
   - _Mitigation_: Start with simple cases, add edge cases incrementally
   - _Fallback_: Accept lower coverage for complex modules

3. **External Dependencies**
   - _Mitigation_: Mock all external services
   - _Fallback_: Skip modules requiring complex mocking

4. **Performance Issues**
   - _Mitigation_: Use in-memory storage for tests
   - _Fallback_: Parallelize test execution

### Scope Adjustments

If behind schedule after Sprint 2:

- âœ“ Skip Phase 4 entirely
- âœ“ Reduce Phase 3 to error recovery only
- âœ“ Focus on reaching 50% minimum

If ahead of schedule:

- âœ“ Add embeddings service tests
- âœ“ Expand integration test coverage
- âœ“ Add performance benchmarks

1. Review previous sprint results
2. Adjust estimates based on actual velocity
3. Prioritize tests based on risk
4. Set up test files and structure
5. Write tests incrementally
6. Run coverage checks daily
7. Review and refactor before sprint end
8. Update this plan with learnings

## Appendix: Coverage Calculation

### How Coverage is Measured

```bash
# Run full test suite with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file with coverage
npm test -- path/to/test.test.ts --coverage

# Generate HTML coverage report
npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=html
# View: open coverage/index.html
```
