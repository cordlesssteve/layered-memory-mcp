## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Principles

1. **Security First**: All new features must include security considerations
2. **Performance Focused**: Maintain <100ms response times for basic operations
3. **Backward Compatible**: Don't break existing MCP tool interfaces
4. **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality
5. **Documentation Complete**: Full API docs and implementation guides

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript Strict**: Full type safety with strictest compiler settings
- **ESLint Enforced**: Code style and quality standards
- **Jest Testing**: Minimum 80% test coverage on new code
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Validate performance on every major change

## Risk Management

### Current Risks

1. **Security Gap**: Multi-user access without proper isolation
2. **Scale Limitations**: Single-node architecture limits concurrent users
3. **Production Gaps**: Missing monitoring, logging, health checks
4. **Performance Unknown**: Load testing under realistic conditions needed

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Security Priority**: Epic 2.1 addresses authentication and multi-tenancy
   first
2. **Incremental Scaling**: Plan distributed architecture for Epic 4.1
3. **Observability**: Add monitoring and logging in Epic 2.1
4. **Load Testing**: Performance validation before production deployment
