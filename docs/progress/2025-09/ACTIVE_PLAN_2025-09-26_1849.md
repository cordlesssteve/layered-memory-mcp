# Layered Memory MCP Server - Development Plan

**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25  

## Executive Summary

Development of a sophisticated, hierarchical memory management MCP server that provides intelligent, context-aware memory storage and retrieval across session, project, global, and temporal layers. This greenfield implementation will synthesize best practices from existing memory MCP servers while introducing novel cross-project insight synthesis and intelligent memory decay.

## Decision: Greenfield vs Extension

**Decision**: Greenfield development  
**Rationale**: After analyzing Memory Keeper's architecture, extending existing solutions would require 70-80% of greenfield effort while compromising the core layered vision due to architectural constraints.
