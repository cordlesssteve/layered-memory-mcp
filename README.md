# Layered Memory MCP Server

## Overview
Advanced memory management system for Claude Code that provides hierarchical, contextual memory storage and retrieval.

## Concept
Create multiple layers of memory with different persistence, scope, and retrieval patterns:
- **Session Memory**: Current conversation context
- **Project Memory**: Project-specific knowledge and patterns
- **Global Memory**: Cross-project insights and preferences
- **Temporal Memory**: Time-based context (recent vs. historical)

## Potential Features
- Automatic context categorization
- Smart memory retrieval based on current task
- Memory decay and importance scoring
- Cross-session knowledge preservation
- Project-specific memory isolation

## Status
**Planning Phase** - Concept development needed

## Notes
This would extend beyond the current MCP memory system to provide more sophisticated, layered memory management for enhanced Claude Code interactions.
