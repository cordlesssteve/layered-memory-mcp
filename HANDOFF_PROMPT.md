# Layered Memory MCP Server - Session Handoff Context

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-01 11:18 **Session Focus**: SECURITY INTEGRATION &
TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE

## Session Summary

**üéâ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Successfully integrated security features (rate
limiting + request validation) and monitoring into the main server, then created
a comprehensive 6-sprint testing development plan to reach 52%+ test coverage.

**KEY ACCOMPLISHMENT**: Moved from "coded but not integrated" to "integrated and
tested" for production features:

- Security features now active in production (rate limiting + validation)
- Monitoring and telemetry operational via MonitoredMemoryRouter
- 35 new tests added (18 security + 17 monitoring)
- Coverage improved from 34.78% ‚Üí 36.76%
- Structured testing plan created with clear path to 50%+ coverage

The system has progressed from "stable core with untested production code" to
"production-ready with security, monitoring, and clear testing roadmap."

## Key Accomplishments This Session (2025-10-01)

### üîí SECURITY INTEGRATION COMPLETE

**Integrated into MonitoredMemoryRouter** (`src/memory/monitored-router.ts`):

- **Rate Limiting** (lines 108-127, 369-383, 408-420)
  - Memory-based sliding window algorithm
  - Per-client tracking using `source` metadata field as client ID
  - Configurable: 15min window, 1000 req/min default (via environment)
  - Applied to: store, update, delete operations
  - Metrics tracked: `memory_store_rate_limited`, `memory_update_rate_limited`,
    `memory_delete_rate_limited`

- **Request Validation** (lines 130-152, 385-403)
  - Zod-based schema validation using `RequestValidator.validateMemoryStore()`
  - XSS prevention: blocks `<script>`, `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`
    protocols
  - Tag format validation: alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores only
  - Content length limits: 100KB maximum
  - Priority range: 1-10 validation
  - Metrics tracked: `memory_store_validation_failed`,
    `memory_update_validation_failed`

**Main Server Integration** (`src/index.ts` lines 59-72):

```typescript
security: {
  rateLimiting: {
    enabled: true,
    windowMs: config.rateLimitWindowMs,     // From environment
    maxRequests: config.rateLimitMaxRequests, // From environment
  },
  requestValidation: {
    enabled: true,
  },
}
```

**Test Coverage**:

- 18 comprehensive security tests
  (`tests/security/monitored-router-security.test.ts`)
- All tests passing
- Coverage: rate-limiter 57.69%, request-validator 42.85%, monitored-router
  58.57%

### üöÄ Sprint 1: Next Week (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Core Router & Layer Foundation (+5% coverage ‚Üí 41.76%)

**Deliverables**:

1. **Router Core Tests** (`tests/memory/router.test.ts`)
   - Store/retrieve/update/delete operations
   - Layer routing logic (session ‚Üí project ‚Üí global ‚Üí temporal)
   - Metadata handling and edge cases
   - Target: Router >50% coverage (currently 23.36%)
   - Est: 200 lines

2. **Global Layer Tests** (`tests/memory/layers/global-layer.test.ts`)
   - CRUD operations
   - Persistence (save/load from JSON)
   - Search functionality and stats
   - Target: Global >40% coverage (currently 13.43%)
   - Est: 150 lines

3. **Project Layer Tests** (`tests/memory/layers/project-layer.test.ts`)
   - Project isolation
   - Project switching
   - Cross-project queries
   - Target: Project >40% coverage (currently 20%)
   - Est: 120 lines

**Success Criteria**:

- ‚úì Router.ts coverage > 50%
- ‚úì Global layer coverage > 40%
- ‚úì Project layer coverage > 40%
- ‚úì All tests pass
- ‚úì No performance degradation

### üí° Key Technical Decisions Made

**Security Integration Approach**:

- Chose lightweight integration without full authentication
- Rate limiting + validation provide basic protection without auth complexity
- SimpleAuthService deferred (not needed for single-user MCP use case)
- Security metrics integrated into existing telemetry system

**Testing Infrastructure Strategy**:

- Focus on core components first (router + layers) in Phase 1
- Target 52% coverage (realistic, achievable in 4 sprints)
- Defer experimental features (embeddings, autonomous, semantic enrichment)
- Document out-of-scope modules clearly to manage expectations

**Rate Limiting Design**:

- Uses `source` metadata field as client identifier
- Delete operations use 'anonymous' key (no metadata available)
- Separate rate limit buckets per client for fair resource allocation
- Failed validation/rate limit attempts still count against limit

## Technical Implementation Status

- Rate limiting: ‚úÖ Integrated and tested

### What Needs Work

**‚ö†Ô∏è Test Coverage Gaps** (Sprint 1-6 targets):

- Router core: 23.36% ‚Üí need 50%+
- Layer implementations: 10-31% ‚Üí need 40-60%
- Advanced search: 1.48% ‚Üí need 40%+
- Error handling: 0% ‚Üí need 50%+

**‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Features** (After Sprint 2):

- Untracked code in `src/analysis/`, `src/autonomous/`, `src/knowledge/`,
  `src/learning/`
- Manual test scripts (`test_enhanced_system.js`, etc.)
- Unknown integration status and quality
- Need to: document + integrate OR remove

**‚ö†Ô∏è Error Recovery** (Sprint 5):

- Circuit breaker coded but integration unclear
- Retry mechanisms coded but integration unclear
- Need to verify error handling is actually active

### Quick Start for Next Session

**If Continuing Testing Infrastructure Plan**:

1. Review: `TESTING_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
2. Create branch: `git checkout -b sprint-1-core-router-tests`
3. Start with: `tests/memory/router.test.ts`
4. Reference: `tests/monitoring/monitored-router.test.ts` for patterns
5. Run frequently: `npm test -- tests/memory/router.test.ts`
6. Check coverage: `npm test -- --coverage`

**If Investigating Error Recovery**:

1. Read: `src/error-handling/error-recovery.ts`
2. Check: Is ResilientMemoryRouter actually used?
3. Grep: `circuit` and `retry` in codebase
4. Test: Trigger failures and verify recovery
5. Document: Integration status in CURRENT_STATUS.md

**If Cleaning Experimental Features**:

1. List:
   `find src -name "*.ts" | grep -E "(analysis|autonomous|knowledge|learning)"`
2. Review: Each file's purpose and integration
3. Decide: Document + integrate OR move to experimental/ OR delete
4. Update: CURRENT_STATUS.md with decisions
