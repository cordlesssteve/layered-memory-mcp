## Next Session Priority

**PRIMARY FOCUS**: Complete Sprint 4 & Assess Phase 2 Progress

**Sprint 4 Status**: ✅ **Monitoring Components ACHIEVED** (performance-monitor:
71.42%, telemetry: 80.91%) ⏳ **Performance-optimizer**: 33.33% (needs just 2%
to reach >35%) ✅ **Overall Coverage**: 41.92% (target 52% for Phase 2)

**Immediate Next Steps**:

1. **Minor performance-optimizer boost**: Add a few more tests to reach >35%
   (estimated: 5-10 tests)
2. **Sprint 4 completion assessment**: Determine if monitoring goals fully met
3. **Phase 2 evaluation**: Current 41.92%, target 52% - Gap analysis needed

**Alternative Path** (if performance-optimizer challenging):

- Consider Sprint 4 substantially complete (2/3 targets exceeded significantly)
- Move to Sprint 5 or other priority components
- Total coverage is 41.92% vs 52% target (~10% gap remaining for Phase 2)

**Strategic Decision Point**:

- **Option A**: Push performance-optimizer over 35% (minor effort)
- **Option B**: Declare Sprint 4 successful based on monitoring achievements,
  move forward
- **Option C**: Focus on other high-value components to reach 52% overall

**Current Production Readiness**: 80.7% of Phase 2 target (41.92% / 52%)

---

**Session Status**: 🚀 Sprint 4 substantially complete, monitoring
infrastructure significantly improved **Test Coverage**: 41.92% overall (652
passing tests) **Monitoring Module**: 57.57% (performance-monitor: 71.42%,
telemetry: 80.91%) **Production Readiness**: 80.7% to Phase 2 target (41.92% /
52%) **Next Milestone**: Minor performance-optimizer boost OR proceed to Sprint
5/high-value components
