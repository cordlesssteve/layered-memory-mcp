### 🚀 Sprint 2: Next Week (READY TO START)

**Goal**: Session & Temporal Layers + Integration (+4% coverage → 45.76%)

**Deliverables**:

1. **Session Layer Tests** (`tests/memory/layers/session-layer.test.ts`)
   - LRU eviction logic
   - Session scope and TTL
   - Promotion candidates
   - Target: Session >60% coverage (currently 50%)
   - Est: 180 lines

2. **Temporal Layer Tests** (`tests/memory/layers/temporal-layer.test.ts`)
   - Archive operations
   - Compression
   - Time-based queries
   - Large dataset handling
   - Target: Temporal >40% coverage (currently 22.52%)
   - Est: 150 lines

3. **Cross-Layer Integration Tests**
   (`tests/memory/cross-layer-integration.test.ts`)
   - Promotion workflows
   - Archival workflows
   - Cross-layer search
   - Target: Integration scenarios validated
   - Est: 50 lines

**Success Criteria**:

- ✓ Session layer.ts coverage > 60%
- ✓ Temporal layer.ts coverage > 40%
- ✓ Cross-layer workflows tested
- ✓ All tests pass
- ✓ No performance degradation

### 💡 Key Technical Insights from Sprint 1

**Test Design Patterns**:

- Use beforeEach/afterEach for clean test isolation
- Test data cleanup with rmdir for file-based layers
- Mock-free testing - use actual implementations
- Test both success and failure paths
- Validate internal state changes where observable

**Coverage Strategy**:

- Focus on critical paths first (store, retrieve, search)
- Test edge cases (non-existent IDs, empty queries, limits)
- Validate configuration options (maxItems, maxSizeBytes, TTL)
- Test cross-cutting concerns (metadata injection, dirty flags)

**TypeScript Considerations**:

- All metadata objects require `source` field
- Use `as any` for testing edge cases that bypass validation
- Cast imported items with `as any[]` for flexibility
- Preserve type safety in production code
