### Intelligent Memory Router
Central intelligence that determines which layers to query based on:
- **Current context analysis**: What is the user currently working on?
- **Query intent classification**: What type of information are they seeking?
- **Relevance scoring**: Which layers are most likely to have useful information?
- **Performance optimization**: Cache frequently accessed layer combinations
