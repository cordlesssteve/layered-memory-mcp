**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25  
**Project Status**: PLANNING PHASE - Research Complete  
**Phase**: Architecture Design  

## Project Overview

Developing a sophisticated, hierarchical memory management MCP server that provides intelligent, context-aware memory storage and retrieval across session, project, global, and temporal layers.
