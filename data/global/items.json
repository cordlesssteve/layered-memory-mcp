Direct instantiation may not establish connection within timeout (5s), while MemoryRouter's integrated instance succeeds. Cause: Constructor async operations complete after instantiation returns. Solution options: 1) Add public waitForConnection(timeoutMs) method for test synchronization, 2) Make connect() public for explicit control, 3) Use factory pattern with async initialization. Pattern: Async initialization in constructors requires careful handling for testability. Prefer factory methods for complex async setup.",

Correct order: 1) Sanitize input (remove XSS, strip tags), 2) Validate sanitized content (check length, format, required fields), 3) Process validated content. Implementation: Reversed order in request-validator.ts, added empty content check post-sanitization. Pattern applies to all security middleware and input processing.",

Result: security/config.ts 0%→91% (36 tests), request-validator.ts 58%→98% (72 tests), semantic-enrichment 0%→96% (44 tests). Total coverage: 45.5%→50.10% (+4.60pp) in two focused sessions.
