Modified closing-workflow/SKILL.md to automatically extract and store memories from CURRENT_STATUS.md during session closing. Memory extraction detects bug fixes, architectural decisions, and workflow patterns using keyword matching. Stores with appropriate categories (knowledge/decision/pattern) and priorities (9/8/7).",
